Arithmetic calculator is a calculator that executes addition, substraction, division, multiplication and power of a number and takes into consideration spaces and parenthesis.
Calculations are processed through a binary tree model. Numbers are representes as the leaves the binary tree while operations as the rest of the nodes. 
Operation nodes that are closer to root will be executed prior to operations closer to the leaf nodes.
